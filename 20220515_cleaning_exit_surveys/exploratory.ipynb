    "To do that, we'll have to compute the service time, or number of years, that an employee spent working at their job. The `tafe_resignations` dataset already has a 'service' column that provides this value. The `dete_resignations` dataset does not, so we will calculate that next by subtracting `cease_date` from `dete_start_date`."
